# Movie Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. It also includes an evaluation function to measure the performance of the recommendation system using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their genre, director, and description.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts movie descriptions into TF-IDF features.
- **Cosine Similarity**: Measures similarity between movies.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates the recommendation system using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Requirements

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scikit-surprise`
- `numpy`
- `nltk`

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn scikit-surprise numpy nltk
